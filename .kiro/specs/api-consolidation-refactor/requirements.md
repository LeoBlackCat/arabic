# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The codebase contains numerous scripts that make similar API calls to external services like ElevenLabs TTS, OpenAI, and image generation APIs. This duplication leads to maintenance issues, inconsistent error handling, and scattered configuration. This feature will consolidate these API calls into reusable service modules with consistent interfaces, error handling, and configuration management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized API service modules, so that I can maintain consistent API interactions across all scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any script needs to make an ElevenLabs API call THEN it SHALL use a centralized ElevenLabsService module
2. WHEN any script needs to make an OpenAI API call THEN it SHALL use a centralized OpenAIService module  
3. WHEN any script needs to make image generation API calls THEN it SHALL use a centralized ImageGenerationService module
4. IF an API service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful fallback mechanisms
5. WHEN API configuration changes THEN it SHALL only require updates in one central location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling across all API calls, so that failures are handled predictably and debugging is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with consistent formatting
2. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN API keys are missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. IF network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry the request up to 3 times
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL include context about which operation was being performed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized configuration management, so that API keys and settings are managed securely in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load all API configurations from environment variables
2. WHEN API keys are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear warnings about which services will be unavailable
3. IF multiple voice IDs are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable voice selection
4. WHEN API endpoints change THEN configuration SHALL be updatable without code changes
5. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL support environment-specific configurations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable utility functions for common operations, so that I don't duplicate file handling and data processing logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts need to read JSON files THEN they SHALL use a centralized file utility
2. WHEN scripts need to sanitize filenames THEN they SHALL use a shared sanitization function
3. WHEN scripts need to process audio/image paths THEN they SHALL use common path utilities
4. IF file operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide consistent error handling
5. WHEN working with media files THEN the system SHALL validate file formats and sizes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate existing scripts to use the new services, so that the codebase becomes more maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating scripts THEN the functionality SHALL remain exactly the same
2. WHEN scripts are refactored THEN they SHALL be smaller and more focused on their core logic
3. IF migration introduces bugs THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capability
4. WHEN all scripts are migrated THEN duplicate API code SHALL be removed
5. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN the codebase SHALL have significantly reduced duplication
