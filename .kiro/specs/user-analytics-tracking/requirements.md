# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables comprehensive user analytics and engagement tracking for the Arabic language learning platform. The system will collect, analyze, and present user behavior data to optimize learning experiences, improve retention, and identify areas for platform enhancement. The analytics system will track user interactions, learning progress, and engagement patterns while maintaining user privacy and providing actionable insights for platform optimization.

5. IF a user drops off mid-lesson THEN the system SHALL record the exact point of abandonment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to calculate user retention metrics, so that I can measure platform stickiness and identify churn patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating retention rates THEN the system SHALL compute 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day retention percentages
2. WHEN a user returns after absence THEN the system SHALL track return frequency and gap duration
3. WHEN analyzing user cohorts THEN the system SHALL group users by registration date and track cohort performance
4. WHEN identifying churn risk THEN the system SHALL flag users with declining engagement patterns
5. IF a user hasn't returned in 14 days THEN the system SHALL classify them as at-risk for churn

### Requirement 3.1

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to detect specific churn signals, so that I can proactively identify users likely to abandon the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN session frequency decreases by 50% over 7 days THEN the system SHALL flag the user as showing early churn signals
2. WHEN session duration drops below 2 minutes for 3 consecutive sessions THEN the system SHALL identify declining engagement
3. WHEN a user fails the same exercise type 5+ times in a row THEN the system SHALL flag frustration-based churn risk
4. WHEN lesson completion rate drops below 30% over a week THEN the system SHALL detect motivation decline
5. WHEN a user skips 3+ consecutive days after a 7+ day streak THEN the system SHALL identify streak-break churn risk
6. WHEN error rates increase by 40% compared to user's baseline THEN the system SHALL flag performance-decline churn
7. WHEN a user stops using core features (vocabulary, exercises) but continues logging in THEN the system SHALL detect disengagement patterns
8. IF a user's last 5 sessions were all under 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL classify as high churn risk

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want an analytics dashboard, so that I can visualize user engagement data and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time active user counts and session statistics
2. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL show engagement metrics over time with configurable date ranges
3. WHEN examining user behavior THEN the system SHALL provide heatmaps of feature usage and user flow diagrams
4. WHEN reviewing learning effectiveness THEN the system SHALL display completion rates, accuracy trends, and content performance
5. IF data is being filtered THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by user segments, time periods, and content types

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to export analytics data, so that I can perform advanced analysis and create custom reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL provide CSV and JSON format options
2. WHEN selecting export criteria THEN the system SHALL allow date range, user segment, and metric type filtering
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include aggregated summaries and raw event data
4. WHEN handling large datasets THEN the system SHALL support paginated exports for performance
5. IF export contains sensitive data THEN the system SHALL anonymize personally identifiable information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to set up automated alerts, so that I can be notified of significant changes in user engagement patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN engagement drops significantly THEN the system SHALL send alerts for unusual decreases in active users
2. WHEN error rates spike THEN the system SHALL notify administrators of technical issues affecting user experience
3. WHEN retention rates change THEN the system SHALL alert on significant improvements or declines in user retention
4. WHEN new user registration patterns change THEN the system SHALL notify of unusual registration trends
5. IF system performance impacts analytics THEN the system SHALL alert administrators of data collection issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to track user acquisition funnel metrics, so that I can optimize conversion rates from anonymous users to paying subscribers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous user visits the web app THEN the system SHALL track their journey through funnel stages without requiring registration
2. WHEN a user progresses through funnel stages THEN the system SHALL record transitions from anonymous → registered → app installed → subscribed
3. WHEN calculating conversion rates THEN the system SHALL compute percentages for each funnel stage transition
4. WHEN identifying drop-off points THEN the system SHALL track where users abandon the conversion process
