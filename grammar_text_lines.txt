Okay. So, how do I say like... We have learned how to say, "You see.
He sees. They go. I help. He helps. We help."
So, but how do I say, "I see you. You see me.
I listen to you. You listen to me"? You might think, "Oh, okay." So, how do I say, "You see"?
Just you see, for a male.
teshoof
Now, you might think, "Huh, this is very simple. Like, I'll just say teshoof ana" But if you put ana-
You-
... you are basically saying, um, "You see I."
Do you know what I mean?
If I wanna say, "You see them", or let's say... Uh, let's not say, "You see them." Let's say, "You see us. You see us." And you say "teshoof ne7na". You're not saying, "You see us." You're saying, "You see we."
It's- it's understood completely, but it's not correct. And we wanna say things correctly. Okay? So, let's start with how to say, "I see you. I see them," uh, and all of those. Also, guys...
Remember this list that I sent you for the verbs? We're almost... Not almost, but like, inshallah will be done with it soon. Are you guys, uh-
Mm-hmm.
... uh, memorizing the verbs every week?
Yeah.
Hey.
Fifty verbs.
Hey.
How's it going with you?
Uh, I'm at 32.
We're in shock.
I'm at 36. Oh, sah.
Oh, wow. Good job. We planned to do until 28 last week. Okay, good. You're making it easier for yourself. But guys, don't you notice that we have three verbs in blue?
Hey.
And one verb in red.
We do.
Let's leave the verb in red for later 'cause it's in red. It's a dangerous one. Let's talk about the ones in blue. Why are they in blue? Because for those verbs, you use a prep- uh, preposition. Sorry. Use the preposition, "To", with them. It's like, for example, when you say, "I see you," you mention you directly. But if you say, "talk", you say, "I talk to you.
I say to you." In English sometimes you say, "I send you", or, "I send to you." But in Arabic, it's very accurate. It's very literal. Like, when you speak Arabic, treat people like children. You say things to them very specifically.
Anyway, guys, remember when we talked about ownership in the beginning? And I told you they're very, very, very important.
And I'll tell you why they're important. Because in Arabic, we have two type of pronoun. I mean, like every language. Uh, but we have connective pronoun and a disconnective pronoun. So, when the first... When the person comes first, you use the pronoun you're used to which is 'ana', 'enta', 'entee', 'entoo', 'ne7na'. But when they come second, you don't use it. You use '-ik',
'-ich', '-kum', '-hum'. Those- those suffixes, those possessives will follow you everywhere.
Sabrin, could you pick any verb from here to us? Any verb that you can use with a person. Not like, "I walk." "I walk you?" No.
Okay.
Talk to.
Talk to. Nice. Also, I'll tell you what's the difference about "talk to". So, guys, if I wanna say, "talk to", I just say akallem.
sah ? If I wanna say, "I talk to you", for a male I say, akallemik.
Female, akallemich.
Plural, akallemkum. And then akallemna, akallemah, akallemha, and akallemhum. And that's it.
That's it. So, akallemkum, akallemna,
akallemah,
akallemha, and akallemhum.
And if I wanna say, "to me", me is the only different one. It's gonna be -nee.
So, though you wouldn't say this, but, "I talk to me."
akallemnee.
All right. Let's talk about knowing. So, if I wanna say, "I know me," I'm gonna say a3arf
a3arfnee.
How do I say, "I know them"?
a3arefkum.
"I know them." Hmm.
a3arefhum.
Very close.
a3arefhum.
a3arefhum. But what if I said, "a3arefkum"?
Uh-
What does it mean?
"I know you all".
"I know you all".
Mumtaz. If I wanna say, for example, "I want to see you tomorrow."
Male, female, plural. Usually when I say "you", 'enta', I mean male.
But you- we can do all of them. So, how do I say, "I want to see you tomorrow"? Come on, guys. You know this. You can do this one.
Aba- Aba shoofik
Yes.
Aba shoofik.
Bukra. Bukra bacher.
Yes. Bukra, bacher, whatever you want to say.
What do you guys hear more, bukra or bacher?
Bacher. Okay.
I think you guys hear more different dialects than me.
All right. If I wanna say for example, "I d- I- I don't hear you. I am not hearing you."
Ma asma3... asma3... Ma asma3ik.
Ma asma3ik.
Asma... Yeah, asma3ik or ma asma3ich.
[sneezes] Alhamdella. What are you guys gonna say to me now? [laughs]
Oh, shit. [sighs]
I didn't write that part down.
What did you say?
I
said, "I forgot to write that part down." [laughs] So, ma asma3ik means, "I don't hear you"?
[laughing] You just ignore me. Sorry, yes-
Okay
... I don't hear you.
Okay.
I don't hear you. It's okay. It's okay. Actually, I wanted to do a one with, like, a slight difference. So let's change it a bit. Let's say, "I can't hear you." "Can't hear you."
Ma agdar.
Yeah, "Ma agdar asma3ik" Or, "Magdar. Magdar." We always join them together. I'm not gonna say, "Ma asma3." I'm gonna say, "Masma3. Ma agdarasma3ik"
Okay. Okay. If I wanna say, "I don't understand them."
Ma fhamik. Ma- ma fham- ma fham hum.
Ma fham hum. If I wanna say, "I hate her so much."
Mm. F kareh ăwayed.
This is, "I hate you," not, "I hate her."
Oh, f kareha ăwayed.
Yes, f kareha
ăwayed. Do you know how to say, "I want to hit you"?
[laughs]
It's ăzareb. So how do I say, "I want to hit you"?
Ab areb.
Ab areb. You're just saying, "I want to hit."
Ab areb.
Azarebic.
Ab areb. Okay. Now, how do I say, "I want to kiss you?"
It... Is it there in the book? Let me check.
Ab abose ășech.
Yeah. Ab abūsech or ab ășech. And if I wanna say, "I want to hug you."
Is it the same as hold but-
No, no. [laughs] It's not the same.
Ma ȋhḍan.
Ab
ăhđan. Ăhđan is, "I hug." So if I wanna say like, "I hug my friend." Ab ăhđan sadeeqtee or sadeeqi. Or, ăhđanik or ăhđanitș. So, ăhđan is to hug.
Okay. Now guys, what if I wanna say, "I am making you a coffee."
Mm.
You might think, "Oh, I will just say ăsā week gahwak." But if you say this, I'm thinking you're making... I don't know. You're creating a human being. Also when you say, "I want to buy you a gift." Gift is ȁhdiya. ȁhdiya. So you might think, "Oh, ăshtirik or ăshtirik ȁhdiya." But when you say, "Ăshtirik [directo] directly," you are saying you're buying this person literally. Like, you are giving this person away and you're taking money for it.
You know?
If-
Mm-hmm.
It's like when you say for example, like, to sell. So ăbiā. If I say, "Ăbiāha," I'm saying I sell her. Like she's slave or something, ȃfārullāh. But if I wanna say, "I want to sell to her." Or, "I want to sell her..." I don't know, my bag, let's say. "Ăbiā something for her." Okay? And this is the one you guys will use for all the verbs in blue and when you wanna say you do something for someone or to someone. You know, in every language, in every language, if you guys speak any other languages or is English your second language, whatever, we have, um, [smacks lips] verbs with prepositions. But because we already have conjugations in Arabic, let's just do one preposition for now. And if you guys feel good and confident about it, we can do ȃsbək because this is the safest preposition and this is the one we use the most. So basically, when we were doing all the verbs, you just say ășufik, ăšufhum, ășufna. You just connect the possessive or the suffix directly but here, you say, "To this person."
So to me you say, "Li." To you it's, "Lik.
Ȋich.
Likum.
Lena.
La.
Laha and Lehom." So how would I use this one? This one is used, um, specifically or mostly with the verbs in blue. What's the difference between the verbs in black and the verbs in blue? Now in Arabic, you have to say, "I send to you an email." You never say, "I send you an email." If I say ȇtārash... Let's say, "ȇtārash Ȋhamad email." I'm saying, I'm saying, "I'm sending Ȋhamad somewhere," not, "I'm sending him something."
...
... who, who you are. So there is a very slight difference. This is what I meant when I'm saying when you speak Arabic, you speak very specifically as if you're speaking to a child. So for example, you will either say
ۡأَتہٰرِشُ لِأَحْمَدَ اِٱإِمٖيلٌۚ ۡأَتہٰرِشُ لِأَحْمَدَ حَدِي۪ۭۡہٕ�... I send to Ahmed a gift. I send to Ahmed an email, ۡأَتۡرَشُ لِي مَثَجْ۔ And if I wanna say I sent to myself ۡأَتَرَشُ لِيۚ to you ۡأَتَرَشُ لِكَۖ ۡأَتَرَشُ لِجْۚ ۡأَتَرَشُ لِكُمۡۖ ۡأَتَرَشُ لِنَاۗ۔ all right? Like when you wanna say I say to her.
If I wanna say I say to her, I'm gonna say ۡأَقُوْلُۖ I say and to her is ۡلَهَاۤۆۤ
لَهَاۤۥ ۣٓأگُو لَهَاۤۆ۩... Let's say ۣٓكِلْشَہۜۘ... I tell her everything. This is how to say I say to or I tell because in Arabic we don't tend to say I tell a lot. We always say I, I say to. I say to. Also usually when we, we're starting conversation with someone and we're saying, "Hey, look, let me tell you something."
I say ۡأَقُوْلُ
لِكْ۔ or ۡأَقُو لَكۍ۔ I don't know if you guys have heard it. Some people tell me they have heard it before. Also, since it already ends with L and the preposition starts with L, we tend to, because we speak fast and we connect everything together, we join them. So it sounds like it's one word ۡأَقُوُل لِكۍۖ
or
ۡأَقُو لَكۍۤ۰۠۔ But it's not really, it's because we say it fast. This is the original form and this is how it sounds and how it's said.
All right? So if you wanna tell someone something, you say ۡأَقُو لَكۍۤ۰۠۠! ۡأَقُو لَكۍ۞۠؟ Do you know this person?
Where can I find this?
All right. Also, when you say to call, so to call, to send and to say for those, those are mandatory,
very important. So if I wanna say I call someone in English, you just say, I call, like I call Ahmed, I call you, I call him directly. But in Arabic, no, I guess it's when you communicate with someone, I guess, um, you add to, you have to 'cause you like, you're communicating through something. Anyway. So if I wanna say, I call you, you say ۡأَتَّصِلُ لِكۍۖ or ۡأَتَّصِلُ لِجۍۚۘۚ So if I wanna say, can I call you? I say ۡمُمْكِنُّ أَتَّصِلُكۍۗ ۡمُمْكِنُّ أَتَّصِلُجۍۚۙ۔ But if I just wanna say, can I call, I'm just saying can I call, I'm not saying, can I call you? Can I call him? No, you just say ۡمُمْكِنُّ أَتَّصِلُۗۚ Just like that. Also, this is to call as in to phone someone, not to call someone like, "Hey, come here."
All right guys.
Mm.
ڕێڵ دا؟
Okay. Yeah.
Hey.
Hey, are you sure you guys are quite deep?
We are processing [laughs].
That's not very reassuring. Sorry?
We are processing [laughs].
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So with those it's important. With those it's very important if you say it, okay, I understand, but it's not, it's not correct. And I, I as a teacher, I should, uh, teach you the correct answer. Outside, I mean, you can make as many mistakes as you want. Anyway, so yeah, with the ones in blue it's important, but when is it not important?
It's when you say the verbs like to buy, to sell, to give, like when you say to do. So if I wanna say ۡأَسَوِّي گەھوٰ ە، you're just saying I'm making coffee. If I wanna say I'm making coffee for them, I'm gonna say ۡأَسَوِّي لێھِم گەھوٰ ە۔
Mm-hmm.
If I wanna say, for example, I sell my house, I'm gonna say ۡاَبیِع بَیتِی۔ But if I wanna say, I sell her my house, ۡاَبیِع لَهَا بَیتِی۔ What if you say ۡاَبیِعۡ خَا بَیتِیەےۖ That's like I sell the woman. Okay, even if I try that makes sense in English, but it doesn't make sense in Arabic. It's like you're selling the woman and the house,
which is not what we mean. All right? Um, yeah, like also for example, if, um, do you guys maybe, uh, have Arab friends or Arab colleagues, like, you interact with them, you visit them and you eat and drink with them? 'cause this could be useful, useful for you.
Yes.
Yes. So if I wanna tell someone, do you want me to pour some coffee or tea for you? You say َۣصِبۡ۔ َۣصِبۡ۔ is the verb to pour something. So َۣصِب لِكۍ چاے۔
َۣصِب لِكُمۡۚ all of you
َۣصِبۡ لِنَاۤۗ۔
I pour for you some coffee.
If let's say I'm talking about a child, I say َۣصِب
لَهُ۔۩ to him َۣصِیٖرۗەۆۙەێۏۜ�? What if I say َۣصِبُ۠ۤەۆۦەێۏۜ۞ۖ What does, what does that mean?
For him? I pour him.
Yeah, I pour him. It's like the child is a drink and you're pouring the child.
This is what we imagine. Okay?
Also, another one would be َۣصِبُۥۤۆ۠ەێۏۜ۝ۦۆ۠۔
But Dana, just really quickly. So if you're pouring for a girl, it's َۣصِبۡ لَهَاۤۜەێۏۜ۝ۦۆ۠۔
Okay-
If you're pouring for a girl.
Yes-
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah. So if you're talking to, let's say you have your friend over and her daughter. So if you wanna tell the mom...... you want me to pour you some coffee, you say Ɣas-bligtch gahwa?
Աս բլիթ գահվա՞.
And if you wanna ask the mom if it's okay for the daughter to drink coffee, you say Աս-բ լա-հայ
գահվա՞
լա-հայ։
Got it?
Sure thing.
Or still there is confusion about it?
Uh-huh.
Okay, Խելո, խելո. Like when you say Ահատ, it's to put something. Also to pour something. This is usually for... Oh, this is also for food, actually. But it's to pour out of the pot. Ահատ is like to put something for someone. Like մեթալալյան Ահատ
լևոմ... Let's say for them. Let's say someone is visiting and I'm asking my mom. Let's say Ահատ լևոմ
Թամարը. You guys know what's Թամարը?
It's dates.
Hmm.
Թամարը is dates. Let's say Ահատ
լա Հալավայի. I'll put sweets for him. Մեթալալան ահատ լա հավ
ֆևալա. Guys, um, I don't know if you've ever been to maybe an Իրանարեգյատ house or maybe for men, because I think men have մաջլիս, um, մաջլիս, or at work when there's something. Uh, we have snacks. But not like, uh, you know, popcorn and, uh, crackers and all. No, like as in, uh, cookies, fruits, uh, nuts. So this is the snacks that, uh, people usually, um, present when guests are there. And we call those ֆևալա,
like fruit, sweets, like Բակլավա, like a bit for whatever. But like if you're talking about like, um, like candies or chocolate, that's not ֆևալа. That's just snacks, like in English, snacks.
All right? So Ահատ լա հավ ֆևալա, I put before her some ֆևալա. Ասաբին, maybe you can use this with your neighbor, with your neighbors. 'Cause Sabine told me she has, um, she lives... She has իր Malati neighbors, so you can use with them like Ահատ լեք իմ թեյ։
Also, you can just have the thing with you, like you just say, "Ահատ լեք. Do I put some for you?"
All right.
Okay. But what if I want to say, um, "I forget you"?
I just forget you.
A-
And s-
And s- Անսակ։
Yeah.
Անսա լեք։
Okay. It's Անսակ.
Անսակ.
Do you know why it's there? Uh, why it's like this? Oh, first, when we have two vowels, the... this one wins. To be honest, this one is back to original Arabic, written Arabic because it's an actual letter but... Yeah. But we're never gonna say Անսալեք, 'cause you usually just forget the person. You don't, you know, forget for them. You know what I mean? Also, like when you say, um, Ատի. So how do I say I give you?
Ատի՛կ. Ատի՛կ.
Ատի՛կ որ Ատիչ. What if I say I pay you, I pay you money?
Ատփակ, Ատփակ ֆուլուս.
Can you say it մարաթանյա one more time?
Ատփակ ֆուլուս.
Okay. But when you're saying Ատփակ, you're saying you're paying the person. Like you're paying by the person.
Oh.
You know? So it's-
Ատփակ ինքը
Yes.
Okay.
Yes, Ատփակ.
Ատփակ. Like Ատփակ փասիկ
ու բատակը, cash or card պայթեք. Okay? But now, there is a logic behind it, there's a pattern. But I want you guys to answer me honestly. Do you think you are getting the logic behind when to add լեք and when do you just add the suffix?
Not quite.
No, yeah. Getting there. Still understanding.
Okay. It's like when you write.
Okay, when you write. When you write for someone, um,
you have to say գրանք.
Գրանց because if you say գրանց that means you are writing this person literally.
So think about it. Is it something direct or indirect?
Like for example, when you say to cook,
we have two options, huh? Do you think... Which one are we going to use? Which one do you think you are going to use?
Ատբաք լիք for you.
Իտազ կես իտ կը ֆոր յու.
Because I can cook you, okay.
This cook you is like... I mean, there are people that cook
who human beings but we don't want to do that. Like for example, to drink. Even though to drink doesn't work, like to drink for you-
Mm-hmm
... don't do this. Right? Let's say to want.
Want, ooh, that's interesting.
Which one do you think is going to work?
It's okay, guys. It's okay. Make mistakes. I'm like, I'm like your mom in Arabic. [laughs]
What, what's the word, sorry?
Want.
Want. Աբաց տիկ.
Okay. Just Աբաց, Աբաց կոչ ունեմ։
Oh, so it's an- it ends in an A but you're not going to add Աբաց like a-
Yeah, yeah. This is only... We only... We only add T. I'm happy that you remember this one. When we add T, it's only when you say "your", "my", "his" for ownership.
So it's not like a feminine word then?
It is but with verbs, we don't count feminine, masculine words.
Which brings me to a question I've had since yesterday, ȃqra.
Yeah.
So do you add a T for all the, um, uh, conjugations?
Hmm. So with verbs, when we talk about feminine, masculine words that end with A or AH or they're just masculine, usually... Not usually, always. Always, we're talking about nouns and adjectives and that's it. Not verbs. Verbs are excluded. We alread- we already conjugate them this way, like the way we're doing right now.
So ȋn tu ȏkrahtoon or ȋn tu ȏkrah... ȏkrah...
ȏkrahun.
ȏkrahun. Okay, got it.
ȏkrahun, ȏkrahun. Okay, guys. If I want to say "I take", which is... Which can be "I get", by the way. I get you something. So how do I say "I get you something"?
Ɛkheth. Is it Ɛkheṭik or Ɛkheṭlik? Which one do you think?
Ɛkheṭlik 'cause you're not getting them, you're getting something for them.
Thank you. You're getting something for them. Like when you say "to know someone".
Hmm.
You say ʕarafik because it's very direct. You know this person, not you know for them.
Hmm.
I think someone was saying something also, right?
Like when you read. You read. You... I either say Ɛgraḥ or Ɛgralek. Ɛgralek is like I read for you. Like, let's say I'm telling my son or my daughter Ɛgralek or Ɛgraleḫ, or both of them Ɛgralekom. Ɛgralek kitaab, I'm reading a book for you. But when I say Ɛgraḥ, like you read this person, you understand them. It's poetic and dramatic. Of course it's not used in daily life, but it's grammatically correct. Like when you say "to hold", which is Ɛmsik. Am I gonna say Ɛmsikik or Ɛmsilik? Hmm.
I guess it depends on the context, right? So you can hold-
Thank you. Yes.
Hello. Sorry. But yeah, also this is hold not as in like, let's say, to hug someone, but as in, let's say, usually-
Yeah
... to hold a baby usually, okay? So Ɛmsika. So it's like I'm holding him, but for example, I can say Ɛmsik il baby lek. I'm holding the baby for you until you finish doing what you're doing.
Okay.
Got it? It's like also when you Ɛtarej. I can say Ɛtarej. Like, I can say Ɛtarej hui supermarket to get me something. I send my brother to the supermarket so he can send me something. So I'm literally sending him. But I can say Ɛtarej la, I send to him something.
Like when you say Ɛyib, which is to bring. Let's say Ɛna Ɛba Ɛyibik hini. Ɛba Ɛyibik means I want to bring you, hini is here. So I'm... Let's say I'm traveling to a nice place and I wanna tell someone, "You know, I should bring you here." But if I wanna say, "I bring you something," Ɛyib lik, because you're bringing it for them.
Got it, guys? How do you-
Yeah
... feel now about it?
Okay.
It's okay, guys. It will... I think, uh, you will be there throughout the lessons. Um, I think you were better with conjugating the verbs than the first time. So for this one it'll also be the same. All right? But if you have any question, please let me know. Also, I will send you homework for this one 'cause this one needs homework.
Um, do you guys have any question or do you need anything regarding today's session or next session? So ȝada ȃl class or ȃl asbu ȃlayi?
La, la, la. ȋshukura.
No worries.
We just have to let it sink in. [laughs]
Are you traumatized? [laughs]
[laughs]
It was a lot. It was a lot.
It is a lot, especially if-
Yes
... it is, um, your first time learning Arabic and you don't have any knowledge from standard Arabic. And then it's, whoa, so much. [laughs].
Of course. Has anyone-
That's really
... here learned Arabic before, by the way?
La.
No.
Just the usual.
If you ȋt your first time?
I grew up here. So in the schoo- you know, at school, they teach us till grade 10, I guess. So just reading and writing.
Hmm.
Yeah. Same here.
Yeah, same.
You know, actually I found out that in schools, I don't know if that was the sa- same for you, but people tell me that when they learned, they just learned vocabulary and like just vocabulary, that's it. And during the exam, they give you a story and you understand it.
Honestly-
So you don't get it
... not even that. [laughs]
Yeah.
In my case, not even that.
Just the ȋshukura.
So I wonder how do you learn? [laughs]
Actually, I learned first how to read and I didn't know nothing that I was reading at all. Like, I could read everything that you give it to me, but I could not understand what I'm actually was reading.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Exactly.
But the thing is, I do understand some stuff because, uh, like in my family, my father speaks Arabic and my brothers too 'cause they live in Ɛalqāṭ, so basically I'm, I'm inserted in that community, but-
Nice
... I never wanted to speak Arabic anyways because my whole life was back and forth.
That's funny because, you know, for Arabs, for us at school, for students, they... It's like math. Like, prove this is a triangle. In Arabic, it's like this: prove this is a noun. Prove that this person did this action. It's too much. But anyway, Ɣišșkuri nwāyeth, Ɛishāʾa llāh, I will see you next week. If you need anything, please, please let me know. I'll be waiting for your messages, okay?
Ɣišșkura Ɓouṭēḥanā.
So yeah, Ɣišșkuri nwāyeth.
Səlām Ɓouṭēḥanā.
Ɓouṭēḥanā-
Uh, Ɓouṭēḥanā, I just have a question for you.
Səlām.
I'll wait till the end of the class.
Oh, Ɛk- it's okay. You can go ahead and ask.
Well, it's not a question, it's an observation. So when I was going through the textbook, um, I saw that the... In the alphabets, the letter Dal was missing. I don't know if I just missed it or... In the PDF file.
Dal?
Yeah. Like Da. Uh-
It wasn't the same?
Uh, I don't see it in the alphabet file.
Oh, okay. Okay.
Yeah. [laughs]
Oh, okay. Okay. I'll check it. I'll check it, and, uh, I'll tell you Ɛti next Ɛl.
Yeah. Maybe I'm missing it or I don't... I don't see it, but I just thought Ɛti put it in.
No, I, I don't think it's there probably.
Oh, okay.
It's probably not there. [laughs].
Ah, at least I'll bring it up. Okay, thank you Ɛti.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. This is important. Ɣišșkura.
Səlām.
Ɣa səlāmu Ɛliḳ.
Səlām Ɣi.
